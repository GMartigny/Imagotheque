        <h2>What am I looking at ?</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine an infinite museum. In it, each painting is 500 pixels wide, 300 pixels tall and completely unique.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each pixel can take any "web" color. A "web" color is defined by 3 component (red, green and blue) that each have 256 possible value.
            Which means that 3<sup>256</sup> equals about 16 Millions possible colors.
            With 150 000 pixels per painting, the total number of possibilities is about 9x10<sup>270926</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, our museum is huge, but finite. We can scour it for years and never see the end, but every 500 by 300 images are in here.
            There's a picture of you somewhere, an all green canvas, a formula for nuclear fusion's reactors ...
